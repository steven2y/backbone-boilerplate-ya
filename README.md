backbone-boilerplate-ya
=======================

This is yet another backbone boilerplate.  As I am a fan of TDD, it also includes two sample apps and the corresponding testing.  Also it was good excercise to muck around with Backbone and requirejs.

The directory structure was influenced by the angular fractal hierarchy as published here

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub 

Here the backbone models/views/etc are clumped together as components so there are all within context.
